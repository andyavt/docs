USB Adapter
===========

We designed our USB adapter so that itâ€™s capable of supporting USB 3.0, should we manage to implement that before entering production (or perhaps for a future revision of uSDR). with an RX-TX optional loopback path for advanced calibration, and many other features, including:

* Six GPIOs exposed to an FPC cable, along with 1.8 V
* TX harmonic-reduction filter for 2.3 - 3.7 GHz
* RX LPF at 3.5 GHz
* A connector for an external reference clock
* Exposed JTAG pads for a JTAG-HS2 adapter
* Mounting holes for a heatsink or enclosure
