* Grab an adapter.
* Peel off the cover shield from the thin thermal interface (0.5mm) and apply it to the top of the adapter where the USDR will be placed.

* Gently plug the USDR into the adapter.
* Route the MHF4 jumper cables from the USDR onto the adapter (refer to the specific adapter instructions in the main menu).
